# Sentiment-Analysis

This project aims to develop a sentiment analysis system for product rating. The main goal of this system is to understand the hidden sentiments of customers in feedback and comments and analyze their product rating patterns. When customers use this app to view products, product features, and comment on different products, the sentiment analysis system will analyze the comments of various users and ranks products accordingly. The system leverages a database of sentiment-based keywords (positively or negatively weighed). When a user comments on a particular product, the sentiment analysis system analyzes the keywords in the comment to find the match with the keywords stored in the database. After analyzing the matches against the positive and negative keywords and sentiments, the system ranks a product by adding or removing from the score, respectively.
